Inspired by the recent success of tRPC and in preparation of a ChiselStrike
example for Tanstack, we have felt the need to enrich ChiselStrike with an
ability to generate strongly typed TypeScript client code.

The idea is to analyze user-defined route handlers, extract information about
what route, query parameters and JSON body go in and what response goes out.
Then use this information to generate a typed client that can be used to
communicate with our backend endpoints. Doing this in full generality is going
to require full-blown type analysis with tsc so as an MVP, we shall start by
generating clients for our CRUD endpoints.

In this series of blog posts, I'll go through the process of implementing this
functionality and together we will examine some of the aspects of this endeavor
that I found interesting. If nothing else, one big takeaway of the story is that
code generation sounds scary, but doesn't have to be if done efficiently.

## Target outline

To illustrate what is the goal, let's consider a ChiselStrike project with one
(heavily simplified) entity:

```typescript
// models/blog_post.ts
export class BlogPost extends ChiselEntity {
    text: string;
    tags: string[];
    publishedAt: Date;
    authorName: string;
    karma: number;
}
```

and a routing map exposing CRUD endpoint `BlogPost`:

```typescript
// routes/index.ts
export default new RouteMap()
    .prefix("/blog/posts", BlogPost.crud());
```

Note: ChiselStrike provides a convenience static method `crud()` which returns a
RouteMap containing all CRUD endpoints for given entity. For more info see
(TODO: ADD LINK TO DOCS).

When designing a new interface, I usually start from what the usage should look
like for an example app and worry about the implementation afterwards. So let's
do that using for our example backend.

First we will need a way of creating the client object:

```typescript
const client = createChiselClient(serverUrl);
```

`createChiselClient` will take a serverUrl of ChiselStrike backend server that
it will communicate with.

Then I would like to use the `client` object to create a first blog post:

```typescript
const post: BlogPost = await client.blog.posts.post({
    text: "To like or not to like Trains, that is the question!",
    tags: ["lifeStyle"]
    publishedAt: new Date(),
    authorName: "I Like Trains",
    karma: 0,
});
```

Notice how individual route segments map onto the client fields (`/blog/posts`
-> `.blog. posts`). But our CRUD paths can contain wildcards to capture
variables. For example, to PATCH a specific blog post, you would issue a PATCH
HTTP request against `/blog/posts/:id/`. This functionality can be implemented
by introducing functions into the call chain. Let's illustrate this by PATCHing
our blog post's tags:

```typescript
const updatedPost: BlogPost = await client.blog.posts.id(post.id).patch({
    tags: ["lifeStyle", "philosophy"],
});
```

## Models generation

From those examples, it's apparent that if we want type safety, we will need to
import the Entity type (`BlogPost`) from somewhere and then use it in our
client. But that's easy enough. ChiselStrike already knows everything about
Entities and their fields. That means we can just query the entity information
from chisel server and then store it hem in a dedicated file `models.ts`.

The generated entity types will be slightly different than the original
ChiselStrike entities because for the client, we don't need anything as complex
as a class. You may also notice the addition of `id` field which is inherited
from `ChiselEntity`.

Put together, we can use the following code:

```rust
fn generate_models(version_def: &VersionDefinition) -> Result<String> {
    let mut output = String::new();
    for def in &version_def.type_defs {
        writeln!(output, "export type {} = {{", def.name)?;
        for field in &def.field_defs {
            let field_type = field.field_type()?;
            writeln!(
                output,
                "    {}{}: {};",
                field.name,
                if field.is_optional { "?" } else { "" },
                type_enum_to_code(field_type)?
            )?;
        }
        writeln!(output, "}}")?;
    }
    Ok(output)
}

fn type_enum_to_code(type_enum: &TypeEnum) -> Result<String> {
    let ty_str = match &type_enum {
        TypeEnum::ArrayBuffer(_) => "ArrayBuffer".to_owned(),
        TypeEnum::Bool(_) => "boolean".to_owned(),
        TypeEnum::JsDate(_) => "Date".to_owned(),
        TypeEnum::Number(_) => "number".to_owned(),
        TypeEnum::String(_) | TypeEnum::EntityId(_) => "string".to_owned(),
        TypeEnum::Array(element_type) => {
            format!("{}[]", type_enum_to_code(element_type)?)
        }
        TypeEnum::Entity(entity_name) => entity_name.to_owned(),
    };
    Ok(ty_str)
}
```

For those of you thinking "Whoooha, that's a Rust code! I haven't signed up for
that!" don't worry if you don't understand everything. We will write
surprisingly little amount of Rust to do the generation.

In any case, the above code will generate the following type:

```typescript
// models.ts
export type BlogPost = {
    id: string;
    text: string;
    tags: string[];
    publishedAt: Date;
    authorName: string;
    karma: number;
};
```

That wasn't so bad, was it? Admittedly, we saved a lot of work by pulling the
already parsed types from chiseld backend. In the future, I want to drop that
dependency, but it will do for now.

## Client object

Now that we have the types, we can focus on the client itself. To make it work
as illustrated by our example above, I think we can leverage TypeScript's object types
which we can nest together and create the required structure. It's simple, it's
typed and it will be easy to generate compared to a bunch of classes. Let's do
it:

```typescript
const client = {
    blog: {
        posts: {
            post: (blogPost: Omit<BlogPost, "id">) => Promise<BlogPost> {...},
            ...
            id: (id: string) => {
                return {
                    patch: (blogPost: Partial<BlogPost>) => Promise<BlogPost> {...}, ...
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Woooha, that's a lot of code! We haven't implemented any of those functions and
that's not even all of the CRUD methods! We are still missing `get`, `delete`,
`put` for both variants, singular(with id) and plain (without `id`). We will
probably want to have some convenience methods for bulk retrieval like `getIter`
and `getAll` as well.

Even if we are planning on generating the code, it needs more structure. Ok,
let's start off by focusing on replacing
`post: (user: Omit<User, "id">) => Promise<User> {...},` with something more
reasonable.

## Function generation in TypeScript

How about instead of generating the function in Rust, we wrote a TypeScript function
that would generate the handler for us? It's very easy to do using arrow
functions:

```typescript
function makePostOne<Entity extends Record<string, unknown>>(
    url: URL,
    entityType: reflect.Entity,
): (entity: OmitRecursively<Entity, "id">) => Promise<Entity> {
    return async (entity: OmitRecursively<Entity, "id">) => {
        const entityJson = entityToJson(entityType, entity);
        const resp = await sendJson(url, "POST", entityJson);
        await throwOnError(resp);
        return entityFromJson<Entity>(entityType, await resp.json());
    };
}
```

From the code it's perfectly obvious what that function does, isn't? Ha! Of
course not! So let's explain what's going on here.

`makePostOne` function takes `url` and `entityType` parameters. `url` tells us
where the request is going to be sent and we need `entityType` reflection
parameter to convert our entity to and from JSON. More on that later.

`makePostOne` returns an async arrow function which has a signature of
`(entity: OmitRecursively<Entity, "id">) => Promise<Entity>`. The `entity`
parameter needs to be `OmitRecursively<Entity, "id">` because when we are
POSTing (creating) a new entity, we don't have an ID yet. The database will
provide it for us. But all of our Entity types contain the `id` field so we need
to omit it. We need to do so in a recursive manner because our entities can be
nested. [An inspiration for the implementation `OmitRecursively` was drawn from
this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54487392/1474847). The return type
doesn't need such a restriction because the function returns the newly created
entity including the `id` field.

Now to the body of the function. You can see that I first convert the entity to
JSON using `entityToJson`.

```typescript
const entityJson = entityToJson(entityType, entity);
```

This is one of those funny little details that look innocent but boy are they
complicated. The reason why I can't simply do `JSON.stringify` is that we
support types like `Date` or `ArrayBuffer` and our CRUD API expects `Date`
fields to be unix timestamp and `ArrayBuffer` to be base64 encoded etc. To do
the conversion, we need a reflection object `entityType` describing the type.
The function will also do some basic sanity checking to make sure that the user
hasn't bypassed the type system and smuggled in some type mismatching values.

This process gives us Json-like object which we simply send down the wire using
`sendJson`.

```typescript
const resp = await sendJson(url, "POST", entityJson);
```

Then I check the response for errors:

```typescript
await throwOnError(resp);
```

And finally do the inverse of `entityToJson` - `entityFromJson` for analogous
reasons which were described earlier.

```typescript
return entityFromJson<Entity>(entityType, await resp.json());
```

Using this approach we can add analogous functions for `PUT`, `PATCH` and
`DELETE`. (You can read their implementation here: TODO(ADD LINK)). Now let's
use them:

```typescript
const client = {
    blog: {
        posts: {
            post: makePostOne<BlogPost>(url(`/blog/posts`), reflection.BlogPost),
            delete: makeDeleteMany<BlogPost>(url(`/blog/posts`)),
            id: (id: string) => {
                return {
                    delete: makeDeleteOne(url(`/blog/posts/${id}`)),
                    patch: makePatchOne<BlogPost>(
                        url(`/blog/posts/${id}`),
                        reflection.BlogPost,
                    ),
                    put: makePutOne<BlogPost>(
                        url(`/blog/posts/${id}`),
                        reflection.BlogPost,
                    ),
                };
            },
        },
    },
};
```

Awesome! This will save us a lot of generation as we can put the functions
`makePostOne`, etc. to a `client_lib.ts` library file which would be just a
regular TypeScript file which can be linted, analyzed or anything that we fancy.

## Client factory

Now that we have a notion of how the client should look like, we can wrap up its
creation into the `createChiselClient` function which we've set out to implement
in the beginning:

```typescript
function createClient(serverUrl: string) {
    const url = (url: string) => {
        return urlJoin(serverUrl, url);
    };
    return {
        blog: {
            posts: {
                post: makePostOne<BlogPost>(url(`/blog/posts`), reflection.BlogPost),
                delete: makeDeleteMany<BlogPost>(url(`/blog/posts`)),
                id: (id: string) => {
                    return {
                        delete: makeDeleteOne(url(`/blog/posts/${id}`)),
                        patch: makePatchOne<BlogPost>(
                            url(`/blog/posts/${id}`),
                            reflection.BlogPost,
                        ),
                        put: makePutOne<BlogPost>(
                            url(`/blog/posts/${id}`),
                            reflection.BlogPost,
                        ),
                    };
                },
            },
        },
    };
}
```

Nice! As you can see, the `url` function used in the previous two code samples
is a simple arrow function that joins given `serverUrl` with relative url of
given route. We need to pass such url to all `make*` functions so that they know
where to send their requests.

## Generating the client code

Now that we know what needs to be generated, let's take a look at the code that
can actually do the generation:

```rust
fn generate_routing_client(routes: &Vec<RouteInfo>, opts: &Opts) -> Result<String> {
    let mut output = String::new();
    let imports = match opts.mode {
        Mode::Deno => {
            r#"
                import * as lib from "./client_lib.ts";
                import * as models from "./models.ts";
                import * as reflection from "./reflection.ts";
            "#
        }
        Mode::Node => {
            r#"
                import * as lib from "./client_lib";
                import * as models from "./models";
                import * as reflection from "./reflection";
            "#
        }
    };
    writeln!(output, "{}\n", &imports)?;
    let root = build_routing(routes)?;
    writeln!(
        output,
        r#"
            function createClient(serverUrl: string) {
                const url = (url: string) => {
                  return urlJoin(serverUrl, url);
                };
                return {};
            }}
        "#,
        opts.version,
        generate_routing_obj(&root, "")?
    )?;
    Ok(output)
}

fn generate_routing_obj(route: &SubRoute, url_prefix: &str) -> Result<String> {
    let mut handlers: Vec<_> = route
        .handlers
        .iter()
        .map(|h| handler_to_ts(h, url_prefix))
        .collect();

    for (segment, subroute) in &route.children {
        let handler = match segment {
            RouteSegment::FixedText(segment) => format!(
                "\"{segment}\": {}",
                generate_routing_obj(subroute, &path_join(url_prefix, segment))?
            ),
            RouteSegment::Wildcard(segment) => {
                let group_name = segment.trim_start_matches(':');
                let url_path = path_join(url_prefix, &format!("${{{group_name}}}"));
                format!(
                    "{group_name}: ({group_name}: string) => {{ return {}; }}",
                    generate_routing_obj(subroute, &url_path)?
                )
            }
        };
        handlers.push(handler);
    }
    Ok(format!("{{{}}}\n", handlers.join(",\n")))
}

fn handler_to_ts(handler: &RouteHandler, url: &str) -> String {
    match &handler.kind {
        CrudHandler::DeleteMany(entity_name) => format!(
            "delete: lib.makeDeleteMany<models.{entity_name}>(url(`{url}`))"
        ),
        CrudHandler::DeleteOne(_) => format!(
            "delete: lib.makeDeleteOne(url(`{url}`))"
        ),
        CrudHandler::GetOne(entity_name) => format!(
            "get: lib.makeGetOne<models.{entity_name}>(url(`{url}`), reflection.{entity_name})"
        ),
        CrudHandler::PatchOne(entity_name) => format!(
            "patch: lib.makePatchOne<models.{entity_name}>(url(`{url}`), reflection.{entity_name})"
        ),
        CrudHandler::PostOne(entity_name) => format!(
            "post: lib.makePostOne<models.{entity_name}>(url(`{url}`), reflection.{entity_name})"
        ),
        CrudHandler::PutOne(entity_name) => format!(
            "put: lib.makePutOne<models.{entity_name}>(url(`{url}`), reflection.{entity_name})"
        ),
    }
}
```

You can notice some minor discrepancies from the example client code above.
Namely I've added the `lib`, `models` and `reflection` imports so that
everything has its place. You may also notice a code that generates different
style imports depending on whether user wants the client to be used from Deno or
Node ecosystem. But apart from that, all pretty straightforward.

## What's next

You may have noticed that our client is still missing the ability to 'get'
things. ChiselStrike's CRUD GET endpoints provide a rich set of filtering
options and additional parameters. To support all of that in a type-safe manner
is not quite trivial and I'll talk about it in a following blog post. Besides
that, I'll also show how to hide paging with iterables.

After that, we will discuss the code behind `entityToJson` and `entityFromJson`
functions and related reflection mechanism.
